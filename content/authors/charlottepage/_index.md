I am a PhD student at UNSW where my research interests are focussed on understanding how hard coral species respond to the host of stressors that threaten reefs. My PhD project looks to bring together an understanding of the impacts of external stressors on coral functioning and health, with consideration of how the physical oceanographic environment can mediate these often-negative relationships. Through studying coral health within the context of the environment in this way, I hope to aid in informing successful management and rehabilitation of these valuable ecosystems.

I completed my combined undergraduate and masters degree in the UK, spending a year abroad studying Marine Biology at the University of Queensland. Far from warm water, I spent a large majority of her masters year working in the collections of the Natural History Museum digitising the skulls of river dolphins. It was during this time that I really learnt how to code in R, and since then it has become a staple of the research that I do. I am a demonstrator on a second year statistics course using R, and have a passion for open science (both for data, and people!).
