Since my undergraduate at University of Auckland, I've always enjoyed statistics and coding in R. I continued using these skills in my Masters at Macquarie University while investigating the intricacies of lizard fights and how it may affect their learning. I strongly developed these computational skills during my PhD at UNSW, exploring the impacts of temperature on lizard development. 

I am interested in understanding why organisms behave the way they do, especially the lesser known ones. I have a passion to teach biostatistics using R, especially to those who feel disheartened from taking the first step. I endeavour to promoting diversity in STEM fields. Outside of work, I enjoy freediving, dancing, hiking and cooking.
