abstract: Have you ever broken your code and/or lost track of the changes you've made? Have you ever trawled through your manual back ups to find some files you've hidden away? Have your collaborators ever emailed you code fixes and you struggle to see what has been updated? Maybe Git can help! Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files and also for coordinating work among collaborators. This workshop was designed for beginners and will guide participants in setting up git. We walked through some key git concepts then, put these into into practice during an interactive session.
