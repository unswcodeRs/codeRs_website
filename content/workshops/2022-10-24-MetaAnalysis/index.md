abstract: In this workshop, we will first go through the ‘workflow’ of what a meta-analysis in R entails. We will then run through some code together on a sample dataset to get a global effect size and heterogeneity, as well as run some meta-regression analyses of potentially important moderator variables. We will also create some plots that are commonly used in meta-analyses. The code we learn in this workshop can be adapted to any meta-analysis dataset from any field.
