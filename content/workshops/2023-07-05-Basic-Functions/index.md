  Have you ever wondered about the different data types and structures in R? Do you know the differences between a character, factor, or numeric value? What about vectors, data frames and lists? What are they and how are they used? Come along to the workshop for a crash course on these coding concepts that are not covered when non computer scientists learn to code. Hopefully, we can help improve the understanding of these fundamental components to increase your proficiency in R coding.
