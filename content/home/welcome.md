UNSW codeRs is a student and staff run community dedicated for 'R' users. We set up events that cater to learning R. We meet fortnightly, alternating between workshops, drop-in help sessions, and other social events. <br><br>

<div style = "text-align: center">
We meet every <strong> 1st and 3rd Monday of the month </strong> during the academic terms. <br> 
You can find us in <strong> BioSciG07 CATS room in Building D26, Ground floor  between 2.30-3.30</strong>. <br> Everyone is welcome to join!<br><br>

## **Workshops**

- We have great workshops lined up for this year, including workshops on purrr, making websites with blogdown, and creating beautiful visualisations with ggplot!
- Check out the [workshop page](https://unsw-coders.netlify.app/workshops/) to find out details about upcoming workshops and resources from past workshops

## **Drop-in Help Sessions** 

- It doesn't matter if you are a complete beginner to R or if you have years of experience, everyone is welcome and encouraged to stop by our drop-in sessions
- This is the perfect space to bring all of your coding questions or even just to hang out and code alongside other R users, so feel free to stop by even if you don't have any specific questions
