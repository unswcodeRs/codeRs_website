UNSW codeRs is a vibrant community fueled by students and staff who share a passion for 'R' programming. Our committee organises relaxed meetings perfect for mastering 'R' and connecting with fellow coding enthusiasts. Whether you're a beginner venturing into coding or an experienced programmer aiming to enhance your skills, codeRs is your supportive haven. 

During the third academic term of 2023  we will meet **weekly every Thursday** (14 Sep 2023 until 7 Dec 2023) from 10:00 am to 11:00 am. 

All UNSW members are welcome, no prior experience needed, no reservations required, and snacks are on us!
