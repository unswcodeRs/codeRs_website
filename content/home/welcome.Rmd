UNSW codeRs is a student and staff run community dedicated for 'R' users. We set up events that cater to learning R. We meet fortnightly, alternating between workshops, drop-in help sessions, and other social events. <br><br>


We will meet every <strong> every other Wednesday of the month </strong> during the second academic term of 2023. <br> 
You can find us in <strong> [Matthews 226](https://studentvip.com.au/unsw/kensington/maps/133861) in Mathews Building ([Building ID K-F23](https://www.learningenvironments.unsw.edu.au/physical-spaces/mathews-building/k-f23-226-mathews-226))  between 1.00-2.00</strong>. <br> Everyone is welcome to join!<br><br>


## **Workshops**

- We are planning two workshops in Term 2, please stay tuned for details!
- Check out the [workshop page](workshops/) to find out details about resources from past workshops

## **Drop-in Help Sessions** 

- It doesn't matter if you are a complete beginner to R or if you have years of experience, everyone is welcome and encouraged to stop by our drop-in sessions
- This is the perfect space to bring all of your coding questions or even just to hang out and code alongside other R users, so feel free to stop by even if you don't have any specific questions
