## What?

Check examples here: https://www.christophenicault.com/post/write_post/

```{r include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='markup'}
theRcode = htmltools::HTML('{{< icon name="r-project" pack="fab" >}} R')
blogdown::shortcode("spoiler", text="Click to view the spoiler", 
                    .content=theRcode)
```




This does not work: https://learn.r-journalism.com/en/shortcodes/mermaid/


```{r include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
DiagrammeR::mermaid("
stateDiagram
[*] --> Still
Still --> [*]
Still --> Moving
Moving --> Still
Moving --> Crash
Crash --> [*]
")
```
