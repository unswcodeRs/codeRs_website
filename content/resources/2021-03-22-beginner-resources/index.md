We all know how difficult and time consuming it is to learn how to program. Fortunately, there are already some great resources out there to help you get started.

1. Come along to our drop-in sessions and workshops to get help and learn new tools in R. Check out the events page for more details.

2. [RYouWithMe](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/): Our first recommendation is series of online tutorials created by members of R-Ladies Sydney who also happen to be part of the UNSW community! Some topics covered in these modules include:

    - Reviewing the basic setup and structure of RStudio
    - Learning about tidyverse and datawrangling 
    - Creating beautiful visualizations with ggplot2
    - Introducing Rmarkdown
    
3. [Danielle Navarro's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DanielleNavarro77/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=3): Check out Danielle's incredible youtube playlists for more practice using R. <br>
    - [say hello to your data](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRPB0ZzEYegPYKRLwJRh4AbWWSiIlzmC7)<br>
    - [data visualisation with ggplot2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRPB0ZzEYegPa4uvvAVJnr6loSKbN4wLb)<br>
    - [dplyr, or a dance with data](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRPB0ZzEYegNFsivhQWTFvKvpEc504EPH)<br>
    

4. [R for Data Science (aka r4ds)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/): The title of this book says it all "R for Data Science: Visulize, Model, Transform, Tidy, and Import Data". This book also provides countless exercises to let you practice as you go. Fortunately, there is also a github page with all the solutions in case you get stuck: [r4ds solutions](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/).
